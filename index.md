<p>I am a tenured research scientist (CRCN) at Inria of the university of Bordeaux. I received my PhD in Computer science from the University of Bordeaux in 2015.
From October 2015 to October 2016, I was employed as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California Berkeley (USA). During this time, I developed dynamic program analyses for communication and synchronization optimizations in large scientific codes. I was supervised by Professor Koushik Sen (UCB) and Costin Iancu (Lawrence Berkeley National Lab).
From December 2016 to September 2017, I worked on the European project HPC4E. My goal was to optimize kernels of some applications developed in the project with the metaprogramming language BOAST. I was supervised by Jean-Fran√ßois Mehaut and Brice Videau. 
In October 2017, I joined the STORM team at Inria Bordeaux as a tenured research scientist (CRCN). Since 2021, I am responsible of popularization activities for Inria research Centre of the university of Bordeaux.
</p>
<p>My research interests are optimization and verification of HPC applications.</p>
