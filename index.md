  <div class="panel-body">
I have obtained a M.Sc. in Computer Science in 2012 from the University of Versailles and a PhD in Computer science in 2015 from the University of Bordeaux.
From October 2015 to October 2016, I was employed as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California Berkeley (USA). During this time, I developed dynamic program analyses for communication and synchronization optimizations in large scientific codes.  I was supervised by Professor Koushik Sen (UCB) and Costin Iancu (Lawrence Berkeley National Lab).
From December 2016 to September 2017, I worked on the European project HPC4E. My goal was to optimize kernels of some applications developed in the project with the metaprogramming language BOAST. I was supervised by Jean-Fran√ßois Mehaut and Brice Videau. 

In October 2017, I joined the STORM team at Inria Bordeaux as a tenured research scientist (CRCN).
