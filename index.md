I am a tenured reserach scientist (CR) in the STORM team at Inria Bordeaux.

I joined the STORM team in October 1st, 2017 after one-year Postdoc position at Inria Grenoble in the CORSE team. From October 2015 to October 2016, I was employed as a postdoctoral reseracher at the University of California Berkeley (UCB).
